			<h2>About the Nighthawk 250</h2>
			<p id="mainpara">The Honda Nighthawk 250 is a standard Honda motorcycle. It features a 234 cc air-cooled parallel twin engine. First manufactured in 1982, the motorcycle has changed little except for color.
The 250 version achieves a top speed of around 81 mph. It has drum brakes and spoked wheels at front and rear, though front disc brakes and alloy wheels are on Australian, U.K. and Japanese models.
The Nighthawk 250 is essentially a light, maneuverable, inexpensive, economical, and easy to maintain bike. With a dry weight of 290 lbs, the bike can achieve <strong>69 mpg</strong>.
It is often used at Motorcycle Safety Foundation motorcycle training. Its smaller size and lower seat make it popular for riders of smaller stature.
In contrast to the Honda Rebel 250, which offers very similar specification, the Nighthawk is considered to be an urban street-use bike, standard street motorcycle. The bike's lineage can be traced back to the Honda CM200 Twinstar of the early 1980s, bored out to its maximum capacity of 234cc.</p>
